## Initial task
Open up the Blockchain login page on the web
(https://login.blockchain.com/#/login).

Login to the site. You will need to have a wallet created for this to have
appropriate credentials. Tip: do not verify the email for the wallet you create,
if you do verify your email it will make the job of automating the login much
more difficult.
